# Railway Management System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive railway management system built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL, supporting user registration, train management, and seat booking with race condition handling.

## Features
- User Authentication (Register/Login)
- Role-based Access Control
- Train Management
- Real-time Seat Availability
- Concurrent Seat Booking
- Booking History

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MySQL
- npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://your-repo-url.git
cd railway-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up MySQL Database
- Create a database named `railway_management`
- Update `.env` with your MySQL credentials

4. Create .env file
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=Root
DB_NAME=railway_management
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_admin_api_key
```

5. Run the application
```bash
npm run dev  # For development
npm start    # For production
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login`: User login

### Trains
- `POST /api/trains`: Add new train (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/trains/:trainId/seats`: Update train seats (Admin only)
- `GET /api/trains/availability`: Check train availability

### Bookings
- `POST /api/bookings`: Book a seat
- `GET /api/bookings/my-bookings`: Get user's booking history

## Security Features
- JWT-based Authentication
- Admin API Key Protection
- Race Condition Handling in Seat Booking
- Password Hashing
- Role-based Access Control

## Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages for various scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling
- Transaction management
- Optimistic locking for seat bookings
